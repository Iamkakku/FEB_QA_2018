Create file using “vi” à vi <filename>
.sh -->extension
--> it will go to vi editor..
press "i"
press "ESC"
TYPE:-  :wq!

sh script.sh

:wq!      - save the file exit from vi editor..

:q!     without saving changes  exit.
Grep:- scan documents

Present the result in a format you want

-v   à shows all the lines that do not match the searched string

-c à display only the count of matching lines

-n à shows the matching line and its number



Pipe-

The symbol  ‘|’ denotes a pipe

Use pipes to run two commands consecutively.

Cat file| grep string



Sort-

Sort – r filename   à reverse sorting

Sort  -f filename à case insensitive sorting

Process:-

Ps command is used for listing the currently executing process

$ps

To kill the processà kill <PID>





File Permissions:-



What is permission?

Accessibility….in simple word

Each file has a set of permission that control who can mess with the file.

There are three types of permissions:

Read àindicates by r


Writeàw
Executeàx

Level of Permission:-

System level
User level
Group level
There are sets of permission:

User
Group
Other
all
When you list the all files you can see

$ls –l

Formate for permission

_rw_rw_r_ _

Permission mode:-

We have  2 types

Symbolic mode
Absolute mode
Symbolic modeà “+” adding permission

                       “-“ remove

                       “=”assigning

Commandè $chmod (using this command we can change mode

$sudo chmod u-r myfile 

Absolute mode:-

0-No permission(000) (rwx) 

Execute(001) (rwx)=1
Write(010)
Write,execute(011)
Read (100)=4
Read ,execute (101)=5
Read, write( 110)
Read write execute( 111)=7
What is LOG file?

Log files are files that contain messages about the system, including the kernel, services, and applications running on it. There are different log files for different information. 

What is shell is scripting:-

A shell scripting is text file that contains a sequence of commands fro OS.

$Vi first.sh



SCRIPT 1:

#PRINT THE VALUE

x=10

Echo “value x is :”$x

Echo “todays’s date: `date` ”

$sh First.sh

SCRIPT 2:

#second script to create directory and create file,add text

mkdir script

cd script

Touch file1.txt

Echo “hi” >f11.txt

Cat f11.txt

Echo “hello” > file2.txt

Cat file2.txt

$sh first.sh

Script:3

# sum,multiplication

a=10

b=20

c=`expr $a + $b`

d=`expr $a - $b`

echo “sum is : “$c

echo “sum is : “$d



echo “multiplication :” `expr $a \* $b`

SCRIPT:4

#input from command line…

count=$#

echo “total cmd line arguments :” $count

a=$1

b=$2

c=’expr $a + $b’

echo “sum is: $c”

echo “multiplication : ‘expr $a \* $b’ “



Script:5

#Input at a run time..

echo “Enter first number:”

read a

echo “Enter second number:”

read b

c=`expr $a + $b`

echo “sum is :” $c

echo “mul is:” `expr $a \* $b`

Script:6

(for this need to create one file”  logfile.sh”)



# read  recent 5 lines in log file with word exception

Echo “this is reading log file script….”

Tail -5 logfile.sh | grep exception



You can also do-----

filename=$1

tail -5 filename | grep exception



Script:

# this is to demonstrate if  condn – to see if number is positive or not.

input=$1

if [ $input –lt 0 ]

then

echo “it is negative number”

elif [ $input –gt 0 ]

then

echo “it is positive number”

else

echo “it is zero”

fi

------------logic:----------

if(num>0)

it is positive

else if(num<0)

id is negative



Script:

#switch case example:

case $1 in

         “car”) echo “this is $1”;;

“bus”) echo “this is $1”;;

“car”) echo “this is $1”;;

“car”) echo “this is $1”;;

*)echo “sorry,..not found match”;;

esac





-------------------------------

switch(day)

case mon: it is mon

case tue:it is tue

case wed:it is wed

case thu: it is thu





Script:

Logic:

print all numbers till 10

i=0

while(i<10){

print hello

i++;

}



#while loop example – display table “n”

n=$1

i=1

while [ $i –le 10 ]

do

echo “ $n * $i = `expr $n \* $i` “

i=`expr $i +1`

done











SCRIPT:

Logic:

for(int I in 1 2 3 4)

Print hello

# this is basic for loop

for i in 1 2 3 4 5

do

echo “hello : : ”$i

done
